# Cat Fact SMS APP

This is the code for the blog post I wrote about add SMS functionality to a Rails App.

### Usage

To get this app running clone it locally. `cd` into the root directory and run `bundle install`. You can then run `rails server` and navigate to `localhost:3000/cat_facts`.

To get the SMS functionality working you will need to sign up for a [free Twilio account](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio) and follow the instructions in the blog post in the section titled _Adding SMS functionality to Cat Facts_.
